3 Types of Machine Learning 

1. Supervised Learning
    Ideal for tasks with labeled data where the desired output is known.
    Examples: Classification, Regression

2. Unsupervised Learning
    Suitable for identifying patterns in unlabeled data without explicit guidance.
    Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

3. Reinforcement Learning
    Best for teaching agents to make decisions through interaction with an environment.
    Like teaching a dog to sit and rewarding if it follows, punishing if it doesn't.
