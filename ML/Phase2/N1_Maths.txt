DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
======================

Mean = (60+70+80+80+85+90+100+100)/8 = 665/8 = 83.125
Median = (80+85)/2 = 82.5 (middle 2 values for 8 students)
Mode = 80, 100 (both appear twice)

MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY
=============================
Mean - average of all values
Median - middle value when sorted
Mode - most frequently occurring value

MODEL EVALUATION METRICS
=========================
Accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN) × 100
Precision = TP/(TP+FP) × 100
Recall = TP/(TP+FN) × 100
F1-Score = 2×(Precision×Recall)/(Precision+Recall)

STANDARD DEVIATION CALCULATION
===============================
Formula: σ = √[Σ(xi - mean)²/n]

Steps:
1. Find mean
2. Calculate deviation for each value (value - mean)
3. Square each deviation
4. Find average of squared deviations
5. Take square root

Example: 70, 32, 68
Mean = 56.67
Higher deviation = more spread in data
